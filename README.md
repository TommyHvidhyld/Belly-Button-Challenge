# Belly-Button-Challenge

An interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the D3 library the json file was read in through the URL provided. The next objective was to create dropdown menu to display each text subject id and then provide a bar chart of the top ten OTU's found in this individual subject.

The individual subject also recieved a bubble chart each sample.

A key-value pair of the individual's demographics was also shown, provided by the metadata in the file.

Lastly a function that operated when the subject id was created and worked on the live server.![Screen Shot 2023-01-12 at 3 59 18 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113069752/212190389-19468260-d045-487f-bbad-793c9493ef8d.png)
